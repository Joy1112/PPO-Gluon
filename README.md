Success

2. Add entropy term to encourage exploration
3. GAE
4. Distributional 
5. Other environments 
6. Bigger -> SLower nets
7. The exploration noise causes NAN gradients, thus NAN outputs
8. Need experience replay because it's OBVIOUSLY forgetting stuff from the past. 
9. Use OpenAI examples



1. Combine 2 nets into one -> Works -> Learns a bit slower I think
